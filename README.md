# Simplistic-RPG-C
Just a small thing I wanted to make might work with it a bit more.

# How do I install this.
Put the project file somewhere then open it and inside there's an `.sln` which you can launch.

# What do the numbers mean?!
`1 - Walls`
`2 - Player`
`4 - Opened Chest`
`5 - Chest`
`6 - Enemy`
`8 - Player Spawn`
`7 - Healing Pool`
`9 - Used Healing Pool`

# Whoa this is the mods ebic game!!
I know right?! It's made by yours truly Mint! :333
Such an amazing creation on `C`!
